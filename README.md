An initial setup for developing my front-end react applications in typescript. 

**Commands:**

* `yarn dev`: launch development server on port 8080
* `yarn build`: build project to `./build`
* `yarn test`: run test suite

**Currently provides:**

* Basic React Typescript template with hot reloading, building with snowpack, so it's super-fast and easy to configure!
* Support for CSS Modules out of the box thanks to Snowpack.
* Testing via web-test-runner and react-testing-library.
* My full eslint configuration is ready out of the box.
